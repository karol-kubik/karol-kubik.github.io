- The higher we rise, the smaller we seem to those who cannot fly.
- WHY DO THESE TESTS?
- As the flagship of the French Army and the country's international showcase, the French Air Force and Naval 
Aviation have some of the most highly trained personnel in the world. With such prestige, the army must assume 
this reputation in order to show its veracity. This is why the French Ministry of the Army, through the 
intermediary of the psycho-technical testing company INFINITE MEASURES, has commissioned us to carry out a 
battery of tests aimed at evaluating the aptitude of potential future fighter pilots to operate in difficult and 
stressful situations. Their stress management, understanding of orders and reflexes will be put to the test in 
order to detect any possible inability to perform a job that requires a lot of resources. Thus, this test serves 
as a kind of "first skimming" to keep only the most suitable students. Afterwards, further tests will be conducted
to evaluate the remaining candidates. Only the best will be selected. The set of tests that we have carried out 
is therefore intended for the student pilots of the army. If you are between 18 and 26 years old, and you wish to
test your capacities in order to apply in the army, we invite you to contact INFINITE MEASURES, which will be able
to inform you in your research, and will redirect you to us if your candidature seems to them possible.
- WHAT ARE THEY?
- The user will perform ten minutes of tests targeting different abilities. He will have to face several exercises 
intended to evaluate his capacity to react in a proportionate way to certain conditions: during the said test, he 
will have to carry out the following tests, four in number: restitution of a tone transmitted by radio, evaluation 
of his heart rate and of the surface temperature of his skin to gauge his resistance to stress, and finally 
reaction time to an expected sound and to an unexpected light. To follow these tests and to be guided throughout 
the test, a small LCD screen will be made available with the instructions of the test as well as a countdown 
before the test starts.
- Heart rate sensor
Your heart rate is measured throughout the test to produce an average and to capture possible excessive changes 
in heart rate during a stressful episode.
- Temperature sensor
The surface temperature of your skin will be analyzed at several points during the test, by the contact of your 
finger with a temperature sensor.
- Reaction time test
This part is divided into two parts. First, the reaction time to an expected sound: your ability to react quickly 
to a command is tested. Second, the reaction time to an unexpected light: how will you evolve in an unstable 
environment?
