		<h2>Description of the website</h2>

		</p>
		<p><B>Objectives : </B>This website is the showcase of the startup AEROPEX. It has two main objectives. The first one is to indicate to any visitor wishing to know more about the company AEROPEX and its employer INFINITE MEASURES what our work consists in. They will then be able to find out how to take the psycho-technical tests, as well as their general content, in order to understand the psychological and psycho-motor skills required to become a fighter pilot.<br>
	The second objective is to make the link between the students, potential future fighter pilots, and their instructors. Through an identification on the site, they will have access to a profile that will allow them several actions depending on their status. Students will be able to access their results. Instructors will be able to enter the results of their students, and consult all of these results at any time. Finally, the administrators will have access to all the data of the site, in order to manage the potential instabilities and problems encountered. </p>
