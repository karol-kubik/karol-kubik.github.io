		<h2> OUR STORY </h2>

		<p align="justify">We are a young startup of six students named AEROPEX. We are responding to the call for tenders launched by the 
INFINITE MEASURES company for the realization of a battery of psycho-technical tests aimed at evaluating the 
aptitudes of potential aircraft pilots, and in particular fighter pilots. Our objective is to guarantee trainers 
a reliable test that can meet their demanding expectations and allow them to know precisely the ability of a 
subject to evolve serenely and efficiently in a particular environment, such as the cockpit of a fighter plane. 
Our tests can be taken several times by each student, in order to quantify their progress during their training. </p>

	<div class="container">
		<h2> OUR OBJECTIVES</h2>
	

		<p align="justify">The purpose of our company is to participate in the defense of France, by training those who, tomorrow, will fly 
over our heads to ensure the protection of the country. The design of this site aims at validating two requests 
allowing us to fulfill our contract with INFINITE MEASURES. First of all, we would like this site to be a window 
on the profession of fighter pilot, and to allow us to arouse the interest of visitors. That's why we attach a 
lot of importance to its design, and not only to its functionality. In this regard, the choice of colors allows us
 to recall the sky, the aviation (the blue of the sky, and the gray of the aircraft), while linking this with a 
touch of modernity, and shades of pastel colors. In parallel, the site must allow to make the link between the 
student pilots and their instructors: it is via this one that both can communicate, and that the results of each 
student are published. Each student can see his results thanks to a private account to which only he has access, 
while each instructor can publish and access the results of each of his affiliated students.
</p>

		<h2> OUR STRATEGY </h2>
	

		<p align="justify">This site is obviously addressed first to the training center linked to the company that hires us, INFINITE 
MEASURES, in order to list all the students tested as well as their results which will then be analyzed by the 
trainers. The student officers will also be able to connect to the site to see their results in the different 
tests, and their potential progress. However, passionate about what we do, we would also like to share our 
experience, and some sections will allow a lambda user, without prior connection, to know a little better our 
young company AEROPEX, as well as the company that hires us INFINITE MEASURES, and the different aspects of the 
pilot's job it claims to train.</p>
